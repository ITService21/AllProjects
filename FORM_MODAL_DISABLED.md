# 🚫 FormModal Auto-Trigger Disabled

## ✅ Changes Made

Disabled automatic FormModal opening in two locations:

### 1. **ServiceModal - Application Process Section**
**File**: `src/Components/ServiceModal.jsx`

**What was happening**: 
- When user scrolled to the "Application Process" section inside ServiceModal, FormModal would automatically open

**What's changed**:
- ✅ Intersection Observer disabled (commented out)
- ✅ FormModal no longer auto-opens when Application Process section is visible
- ✅ `hasTriggeredForm` state variable commented out (no longer needed)

**User can still**:
- ✅ Manually click buttons to open FormModal
- ✅ Use the "Check Your Eligibility" button
- ✅ View all ServiceModal content without interruption

---

### 2. **Service Pages - CTA Section (Bottom of Page)**
**File**: `src/hooks/useCTAModal.js`

**What was happening**: 
- When user scrolled to the bottom of service pages (Funding, Certificate, Marketing, Legal, etc.), FormModal would automatically open

**What's changed**:
- ✅ Intersection Observer disabled (commented out)
- ✅ Scroll tracking disabled (no longer tracks if user scrolled from top)
- ✅ FormModal no longer auto-opens when reaching end of service pages
- ✅ Unused state variables commented out
